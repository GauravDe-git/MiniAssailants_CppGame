 Maybe-Enemy shouldnt turn in direction of player in middle of attack
      or when dying?

 - Change level looks like a button. (x)
 - Buttons sprites look bad, have artifacts compression. (x)
 - defender complaining about .exe .  ???? - added icon (x)
 - sfx like the coin/hp/mp too loud/harsh. (x)

 -AI, rathr than making it flinch back every time its hit, maybe have some value per monster type that makes it resistant to flinching, 
 and only have it flinch when its hit enough (and would reset after not being hit for N amount of time)
that would give it some resistance to the spam attack problem
being able to block might also be a thing
would introduce light+heavy hit mechanics

- One way to improve the ai is by adding collision. Just push the player out of the enemy when inside.

 Player Face Portrait
 Floating damage numbers.
 Add a pause menu. Maybe a button on top right, can be clicked, or press esc/p to go menu,
 with options to go back to main menu or quit.

 Change the stats like player hp,mp,dmg,enemy- hp,dmg using JSON instead 
 of hardcoding

 Player and enemy sprite reflections. (Flip,reduce alpha values,etc)
