 - defender complaining about .exe .  ???? - added icon (x)

 -AI, rathr than making it flinch back every time its hit, maybe have some value per monster type that makes it resistant to flinching, 
 and only have it flinch when its hit enough (and would reset after not being hit for N amount of time)
that would give it some resistance to the spam attack problem
being able to block might also be a thing
would introduce light+heavy hit mechanics

-Add a pause menu. Maybe a button on top right, can be clicked, or press esc/p to go menu,
 with options to go back to main menu or quit.
